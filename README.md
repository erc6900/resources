A collection of resources for all things [ERC-6900](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6900).

ERC-6900 provides smart contract interfaces and guidelines that allow for composable logic within smart contract accounts, with the goal of reducing fragmentation in the growing smart account and plugin ecosystems.
